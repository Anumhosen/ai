                <p>At a very high level, machine learning is the process of teaching a computer system how to make accurate predictions when fed data. Those predictions could be answering whether a piece of fruit in a photo is a banana or an apple, spotting
                    people crossing the road in front of a self-driving car, whether the use of the word book in a sentence relates to a paperback or a hotel reservation, whether an email is spam, or recognizing speech accurately enough to generate captions

                        <span>YouTube</span></a> video. The key difference from traditional computer software is that a human developer hasn't written code that instructs the system how to tell the difference between the banana and the apple. Instead
                    a machine-learning model has been taught how to reliably discriminate between the fruits by being trained on a large amount of data, in this instance likely a huge number of images labelled as containing a banana or an apple.<em>

                <p>It involves choosing a sequence of actions that will (with a high likelihood) transform the state of the world, step by step, so that it will satisfy the goal. The world is typically viewed to consist of atomic facts (state variables),
                    and actions make some facts true and some facts false. In the following we discuss a number of ways of formalizing planning, and show how the planning problem can be solved automatically. In known environments with available models,
                    planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the strategy often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort
                    to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence. These include dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often

                    athand use hit and trial method to check for various solutions to that problem.This hit and trial approach usually works well for trivial problems and is referred toas the classical approach to problem solving.Consider the maze searching
                    problem. The mouse travels though one path andfinds that the path leads to a dead end, it then back tracks somewhat and goesalong some other path and again finds that there is no way to proceed. It goes onperforming such search, trying
                    different solutions to solve the problem until asequence of turns in the maze takes it to the cheese. Hence, of all the solutionsthe mouse tries, the one that reached the cheese was the one that solved theproblem.

            <p>Most researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how AI might become
                a risk,
                <span class="bold-em">experts think two scenarios most likely:</span></p>

                    <th>1- The AI is programmed to do something devastating:</th>
                    <th>2- The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal:</th>

                    <td>
                        - Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results
                        in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply “turn off,” so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that’s present
                        even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        - This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI’s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered
                        in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts
                        to stop it as a threat to be met.
